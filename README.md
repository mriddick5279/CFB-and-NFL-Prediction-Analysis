# CFB-and-NFL-Prediction-Analysis
This repository hosts how I analyzed my prediction data for both College Football and the NFL for each I season I did predictions for. It's all written in Python and utilizes pandas. CSV files are included

# Using any Analysis Script
There are few steps you'll need to setup and a couple of different ways you can choose to do this

## OPTION 1: Using the Command Line
1. Download the latest version of [Miniconda]([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)). You will need to scroll down the page to see the Miniconda installers, and then choose the appropriate installer for your system (Windows, Mac, or Linux). When following the launcher, if it gives you the option to add it to your PATH variable, select yes.
2. Using you computer's search feature, find the **Anaconda Prompt**. Don't worry about the name of this prompt, it is still running Miniconda.
3. Download this repository by cliking on **Code > Download ZIP** at the top of the main page of the repository. Extract all files from the .zip file to wherever you want on your device when it is finished downloading.
4. Using the Anaconda Prompt, navigate to the location of the file/folder on your device that contains the **analysis.py** script. To do this, use the **cd** command. This command allows you to navigate through your file/folder system on your device. The Anaconda Prompt will typically start you at the location **C:\Users\your_device_username**, so, for example, if you downloaded and extracted the files to your Desktop, you would use the cd command as follows:
```
cd "Desktop\CFB-and-NFL-Prediction-Analysis\CFB Predictions 2024-25"
```
> [!CAUTION]
> Quotation marks are only present here since the destination folder name **CFB Predictions 2024-25** contains spaces here. When you get to the **CFB-and-NFL-Prediction-Analysis** folder, it is best to press enter, then type in **cd C** and press **TAB** to autofill the folder name for you. It will automatically include the quotes so that you don't have to type them in.
